# TrussBot
The simulation and multi-objective optimization framework for trussBot.

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Examples
1. Train a table for multiple objectives with pure GA.
```bash
python examples/train_table_GA.py
```
GA results will be under './output/GA_{Data}-{Time}' folder, named as 'iPool_{# of generations}' 

2. Visualize the GA result.
```bash
python examples/show_table.py
```

3. Train RL on top of a GA optimized truss.
```bash
python utils/ppo/main.py
```
A gym environment will be initialized based a GA result. 
You can change the GA result by changing the following three lines in the ``main.py`` file.
```python
data = pickle.load(open('./output/GA_531-8-36-53/iPool_580', 'rb'))
moo = data['elitePool'][5]['moo']
iObjective = 1
```

4. To visualize the training result.
```bash
python utils/ppo/visualize.py --env-name='trained_0613'
```
Make sure the GA result is the same as the one in ``main.py``
Change the env-name to the .pt file generated by ``main.py``, which is by default in the trained_models directory.
Keep closing the visualization window to see the frame-by-frame motions
