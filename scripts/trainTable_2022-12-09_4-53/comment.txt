Elite 1 of 2022-12-09_04-53-16/ElitePool_15.gacheckpoint.npy is very good.
In addition to the smooth walking, it also has very gentle left turn.
The lowering body still causes the top to tilt.
The tilting causes table to lower.

After referring to Elite 0, I changed one digit in the 4th action of Elite 1 and it's tilting looks good now.

I save the modified Elite 1 to "trainTable_2022-12-09_5-05". Let's see.
